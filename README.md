## What is Viper?

Viper is a complete configuration solution for go applications including 12 factor apps. It is designed
to work within an application, and can handle all types of configuration needs
and formats. It supports:

* setting defaults
* reading from JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, and Java properties config files
* live watching and re-reading of config files (optional)
* reading from environment variables
* reading from remote config systems (etcd or Consul), and watching changes
* reading from command line flags
* reading from buffer
* setting explicit values

Viper can be thought of as a registry for all of your applications
configuration needs.

## Q & A

Q: Why not Terraform?

A: Terraform is a real cool piece of software. But I wanted to do something in Go.
And I wanted it to follow the unix philosophy - one tool for one job.
